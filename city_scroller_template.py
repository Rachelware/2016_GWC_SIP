	  Together the x_point and y_point represent the top, left corner of the building

	  width - an integer that represents how wide the building will be in pixels.
			A positive integer draws the building right to left(->).
			A negative integer draws the building left to right (<-).
	  height - an integer that represents how tall the building will be in pixels
			A positive integer draws the building up 
			A negative integer draws the building down 
	  color - a tuple of three elements which represents the color of the building
			Each element being a number from 0 - 255 that represents how much red, green and blue the color should have.

		pygame being initialized in the environment.

		height - an integer that represents in pixels the height scroller
			A negative integer here will draw the buildings upside down.
		base - an integer that represents where along the y-axis to start drawing buildings for this
			A negative integer will draw the buildings off the screen
			A smaller number means the buildings will be drawn higher up on the screen
			A larger number means the buildings will be drawn further down the screen
			To start drawing the buildings on the bottom of the screen this should be the height of the screen
